Step 1 : clarify functional requirements

Entry flow:
-> Vehicles arrive at gate
-> Assign slot based on vehicle type
-> Generate ticket
-> Mark slot as occupied
-> Return entry response

Exit flow:
-> Present ticket
-> Calculate fees using pricing rules
-> Process payment
-> Release slot
-> Return exit response with receipt

Admin flow:
-> Add/edit/update/delete floors and slots
-> Define update pricing rules
-> View parking lot status

Edge cases:
-> Payment failure at exit
-> Lost ticket
-> System clock mismatch
-> Slot marked occupied wrongly

Step 2 : Identify core entities

Vehicle:
- id uuid
- licensePlate string
- vehicleType enum

Slot:
- id uuid
- slotType enum
- isOccupied boolean
- floorNumber int

Floor:
- id uuid
- floorNumber int
- slots List<Slot>

Ticket:
- id uuid
- vehicleId uuid
- slotId uuid
- entryTime time
- isActive boolean

Receipt:
- id uuid
- ticketId uuid
- exitTime time
- totalFee double
- paymentStatus enum

PricingRule:
- vehicleType
- ratePerHour
- flatRate
- ruleType

Payment:
- id uuid
- ticketId uuid
- amount double
- status enum

EntryResult/ExitResult:
- success boolean
- data response
- message string

Step 3 : Visual Interaction flows

Entry flow:
- Vehicle arrives
- Slot allocated
- Ticket generated
- Slot marked as occupied

Exit flow:
- Ticket scanned
- Fee calculated
- Payment processed (with retries)
- Receipt generated
- Slot released
- Ticket deactivated

Admin flow:
- Add floor
- Add slot
- Update pricing

Step 4 :
Client layer -> Controller layer -> Service layer -> Repository layer -> Entity layer

Controller layer:
- EntryController.enterVehicle()
- ExitController.exitVehicle()
- AdminController.addFloor(), addSlot(), updatePricing()

Services:

TicketService: Generate and retrieve ticketsS

SlotService: Allocates and releases parking slots

PricingService: Calculates fees based on parking duration and typeP

PaymentService: Processes payments for parking tickets

ReceiptService: Generate receipts after payment

AdminService: Handles administrative tasks

Repositories:
Managing CRUD operations

Interfaces:
- Abstracting payment gateway interactions


Step 5 : Implement core use cases

Entry flow:

enterVehicle() -> SlotService.allocateSlot() -> TicketService.generateTicket() ->
TicketRepositor.save() -> Return entryResult

exitVehicle() -> GetTicket -> CalculateFee -> ProcessPayment(with retries) ->
Release slot -> Generate Receipt -> Return exitResult
